    <h3>My Study Abroad Journey in Canada</h3>
        <p>Deciding to go to Canada to study abroad is one of the most important decisions in my life. It all began when I was in high school in Hanoi, Vietnam,
            surrounded by the familiar sights and sounds of my hometown. While I loved my life there, I often found myself dreaming of new experiences and adventures in a foreign land.
            At 18, I left Vietnam to study abroad in Canada, completing grades 11 and 12. </p>
        <p>Arriving in Canada was a whirlwind of emotions. The first time being in Toronto, I felt a mix of awe and anxiety. Everything was so new—the sounds, the people,
            and the pace of life. It was a bit overwhelming, but I quickly learned that everyone was welcoming and eager to connect. As I settled into my new life, I discovered
            the beauty of studying in a diverse environment. Beyond academics, I also made a lot of friends thorough my journey. </p>
        <p>During high school in Canada, I took several programming courses that I thoroughly enjoyed, which inspired me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. 
            After graduating, I continued my education in post-secondary studies and applied for the Computer Science program at Toronto Metropolitan University, 
            where I'm currently still studying.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on my decision to study abroad, I realize that it has transformed me in ways I never anticipated. I've become more independent, adaptable, 
            and open-minded. This journey has taught me that stepping out of my comfort zone can lead to extraordinary growth.</p>
