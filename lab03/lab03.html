            <h2>Part C</h2>
            <p>
                In Part A, the approach of creating a responsive webpage using pure HTML and CSS has given me many challenges. First,
                I had to manually write fluid grid layouts and media queries for different screen sizes and then create the content.
                Ensuring the webpage looked appealing across various screen sizes while maintaining text readability was particularly tricky.
                In general, HTML and CSS give me more control over styles and layouts especially when I want to create unique designs tailored to my preferences 
                without being restricted by a framework's predefined styles.</p>

            <p>For me, Part B was much easier to do because Bootstrap framework has simplified the development process significantly.
                I can just use pre-defined grid system and responsive classes of Bootstrap framework, hence, I can quickly create a functional
                layout without writing extensive custom CSS. This implementation is way faster and easier and it's also very friendly with beginners.</p>
                
            <p>Overall, while both methods have their pros and cons, I found the Bootstrap approach to be more efficient and user-friendly, allowing me to focus 
                more on content creation rather than layout complications.</p>
